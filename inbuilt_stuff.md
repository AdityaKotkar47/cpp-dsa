- `swap()` - swaps two values using reference

-   - `max()` - calculates maximum between two values
        - use `max(a, max(b, c))` approach for calculating maximum value between multiple variables
        - if you add anything to it, then it'll become negative
    -  `min()` - calculates minimum between two values
        - use `min(a, min(b, c))` approach for calculating minimum value between multiple variables
        - if you subtract anything from it, then it'll become positive

-   - `INT_MIN` is the lowest possible integer value [use for initializing max value variables]
    - `INT_MAX` is the highest possible integer value [use for initializing min value variables]

- `sort(begin_iterator, end_iterator)` - sorts the elements of a container in ascending order
